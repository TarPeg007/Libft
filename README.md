🎉 Libft - Your First C Library 🎉

Introduction

Coding in C without standard functions? 😱 Let's fix that! This project is all about building your own C library, libft, packed with handy functions you'll use in future assignments. Take your time to expand and improve it throughout the year! 📚✨

Rules of the Game
Write everything in C. 🖥️
Follow the Norm (no errors allowed)! 🛑
No unexpected crashes (segfaults, etc.). 💥
Free all heap-allocated memory (no leaks!). 🚰
Submit a Makefile that compiles with -Wall -Wextra -Werror and doesn't relink. 🛠️
Include these Makefile rules: $(NAME), all, clean, fclean, re, and bonus. 📜
If you use libft in other projects, include its source and Makefile in a libft folder. 📁
Create test programs to make your life easier! 🧪


Makefile Cheat Sheet
make or make all - Build the library. 🏗️
make clean - Delete object files. 🧹
make fclean - Delete object files and the library. 🗑️
make re - Rebuild the library. 🔄
make bonus - Build the bonus files. 🎁
